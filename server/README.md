# Joshinkan Backend

An FCGI-based backend to parse form data and send emails.

## Development

### Testing

Make sure to set the environment variabel `USE_LINEBREAK=1` for your test configuration. This is required to use `LF (\n)` newlines for test fixtures instead of browser default `CRLF (\r\n)` newlines.
